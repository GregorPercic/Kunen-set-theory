# Kunen's set theory (book)

This is a formalization of a fragment of set theory in *The Foundations of Mathematics* by Kenneth Kunen. It builds on the results from [this repository by Trebor Huang](https://github.com/Trebor-Huang/ZFC) (all work original to him, with some minor modifications, is in `Trebor-Huang`). The PDF file is the source text for the formalization.

Goals reached thus far:
- Burali-Forti paradox.
